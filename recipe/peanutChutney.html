        Peanut Chutney Recipe

This recipe provides a detailed guide to making a rich and flavorful Peanut Chutney, a versatile condiment perfect for South Indian breakfasts and snacks.

Yields: Approximately 1.5 cups
Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook Time: 15 minutes

Ingredients:

For the Chutney Base:
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 handfuls raw peanuts
½ teaspoon ginger, finely minced
½ teaspoon garlic, finely minced
1 teaspoon chili flakes
1 small onion, finely chopped (approximately 1 handful)
Salt, to taste
1 teaspoon chili powder
4-5 tablespoons water (adjust as needed)
1 small piece of tamarind (chana-sized, optional)
For the Tempering (Tadka):
2 tablespoons coconut oil
¼ teaspoon mustard seeds
1 shallot, thinly sliced (approximately 1 tablespoon)
A few fresh curry leaves
Instructions:

Roasting the Peanuts:

Heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.
Add the raw peanuts and roast them, stirring frequently, until they are lightly browned and their aroma is released. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
Sautéing Aromatics:

Once the peanuts are roasted, add the minced ginger and garlic to the pan. Sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add the chili flakes and the finely chopped onion. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
Add salt to taste.
Reduce the heat to low. Add the chili powder and sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of the chili powder disappears.
Grinding the Chutney:

Turn off the heat and transfer the roasted peanut mixture to a blender or food processor.
Add 4-5 tablespoons of water (or more, as needed, for a smooth consistency).
If using, add the small piece of tamarind.
Grind the mixture into a smooth paste. Set aside.
Tempering (Tadka):

In the same pan, heat 2 tablespoons of coconut oil over medium heat.
Add the mustard seeds and allow them to splutter.
Add the thinly sliced shallot and sauté until it turns golden brown.
Add the curry leaves and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.
Combining and Finishing:

Immediately pour the ground peanut paste into the pan with the tempering.
Mix thoroughly and cook for about 1 minute, stirring continuously.
Turn off the heat. The Peanut Chutney is ready to serve.
Tips and Variations:

Adjust the amount of chili flakes and chili powder to your preferred spice level.
For a richer flavor, use fresh curry leaves and coconut oil.
If you prefer a thinner chutney, add more water while grinding.
You can add a small piece of jaggery for a hint of sweetness.
For a different taste, you can add a tablespoon of roasted gram dal to the mixture before grinding.
This chutney pairs excellently with idli, dosa, vada, or uttapam.1
