            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
                <li>1 small head of cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 green chilies, slit</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
                <li>1 medium tomato, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>2.5 teaspoons chili powder</li>
                <li>1.5 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable masala</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The vegetables: Wash and cube the potatoes. Wash the cauliflower and cut it into florets.</li>
                <li>Sauté the potatoes: Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a kadai (wok or deep frying pan) over medium heat. Add the cubed potatoes and sauté for a few minutes until they start to brown slightly. Remove the potatoes from the kadai and set aside.</li>
                <li>Sauté the cauliflower: In the same kadai, add the cauliflower florets and sauté for a few minutes until they are lightly browned. Remove the cauliflower and set aside.</li>
                <li>Sauté the aromatics: Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the kadai. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add spices and tomatoes: Add the slit green chilies and ginger-garlic paste. Sauté for a minute until the raw aroma of ginger-garlic disappears. Add the chopped tomato and sauté until it becomes mushy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add dry spices: Reduce the flame to low. Add turmeric powder, chili powder, coriander powder, vegetable masala, and salt. Mix well and sauté for a minute until the spices release their aroma. Be careful not to burn the spices.</li>
                <li>Combine vegetables: Add the sautéed potatoes and cauliflower to the kadai. Mix well to coat the vegetables with the spice mixture.</li>
                <li>Cook the Aloo Gobi: Cover the kadai and cook for 2-3 minutes on low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Add garam masala: Open the lid and add the garam masala. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Dry roast: Increase the heat to medium.  Cook the Aloo Gobi uncovered for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking or burning. This process helps to dry out any excess moisture and enhance the flavors.</li>
                <li>Garnish and serve: Add the chopped coriander leaves and mix well.</li>
                <li>Serve hot:  Aloo Gobi is now ready to be served. It pairs well with roti, paratha, rice, or naan.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tips and Variations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can adjust the amount of chili powder according to your spice preference.</li>
                <li>For a richer flavor, you can add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) to the oil along with the cumin seeds.</li>
                <li>You can also add other vegetables like peas or carrots to this dish.</li>
                <li>If you prefer a gravy-based Aloo Gobi, you can add a little water after adding the spices and let it simmer until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the vegetables are cooked through but not mushy.</li>
                <li>Adjust salt according to taste.</li>
            </ul>
